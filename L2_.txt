1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	The .git folder is created and the files and commits start to be tracked.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area contains the files that will be commited the next time. The working directory is the folder where we are currently at and the repository is where the versions of all previous commits are being tracked.
