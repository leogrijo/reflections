1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I want/need to collaborate with other developers. It is also good to keep an online backup of the project.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	To avoid making local changes based on the remote that could break something (and it would be broke on both places).

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork - A special type of clone, but done on GitHub when we want to use someone else's repository without making changes to it (and/or we don't have access/permition to edit it).
	Clone - When a remote repository is cloned to our local machine in order for us to edit it locally.
	Branch - When a repository is divided into more than one and we keep working on both. Generally used adding a new feature or making tests that could break the main branch (branching it avoids that risk).
